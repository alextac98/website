I recently purchased an Ender 3, and want to share the tips and tricks I've collected along the way. The Ender 3 is an incredible value for a 3D printer, but there are several upgrades and modifications that can significantly improve print quality and user experience.

## Recommended Upgrades

### Printable Upgrades (Free!)

These are upgrades you can print yourself on your Ender 3:

## OctoPrint Setup

One of the best upgrades you can make is adding OctoPrint for remote monitoring and control. Here's a great guide to get you started:

With OctoPrint, you can:

- Monitor prints remotely via webcam
- Start and stop prints from your phone or computer
- Track print progress and time remaining
- Access a wealth of plugins for additional functionality

## Tips and Tricks

### Bed Leveling

Take your time with bed leveling - it's the most important factor for successful prints. Use the paper method and check all four corners multiple times until they're consistent.

### First Layer

The first layer is critical. Make sure it's squished enough to adhere but not so much that it's transparent. A good first layer should have slight ridges between the lines.

### Bed Adhesion

- Clean your bed with isopropyl alcohol before each print
- For PLA, a bed temperature of 60°C works well
- Consider using a glue stick or hairspray for difficult prints

### Print Settings

Start with proven settings before experimenting:

- **PLA**: 200°C nozzle, 60°C bed
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm for normal prints, 0.12mm for detailed prints
- **Print Speed**: 50mm/s is a safe starting point

I'll continue to update this post as I discover more useful upgrades and tips!
