In order to get an accurate measurement of a partially used spool of filament, I am compiling the average weight for empty and full spools of different materials from different companies I've used over the years.

## Why Track Spool Weights?

When you're in the middle of a long print, knowing exactly how much filament you have left can be crucial. By weighing your current spool and comparing it to known weights, you can calculate approximately how much filament remains and whether you have enough for your next print.

## Filament Spool Weight Reference Table

The table below will be compiled with more data as I obtain it! If you would like to contribute, drop a comment below!

| Brand    | Filament Type | Spool Size | Full Spool Weight (lbs) | Empty Spool Weight (lbs) |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Eryone   | PLA (White)   | 1kg        | N/A                     | N/A                      |
| Hatchbox | PLA (Black)   | 1kg        | 2.253                   | -                        |

## How to Use This Table

1. **Weigh your current spool** - Use a kitchen scale or postal scale
2. **Subtract the empty spool weight** - This gives you the remaining filament weight
3. **Calculate percentage remaining** - Divide by the original filament weight (usually 1kg)

## Contributing

If you have data from spools you've used, please share in the comments! Include:

- Brand name
- Filament type and color
- Spool size (1kg, 500g, etc.)
- Full spool weight (with filament)
- Empty spool weight (after using all filament)

I'll add your data to the table to help the community!
