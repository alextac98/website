## The Experience

Appearing on The Tonight Show was a surreal experience. Getting to demonstrate Project Maverick - my omni-directional robotic mobility system designed to help people with walking disabilities - to Jimmy Fallon and the studio audience was a dream come true and one of the highlights of my life.
