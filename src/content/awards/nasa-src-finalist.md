## What is NASA's Space Robotics Challenge?

The NASA Space Robotics Challenge was an industry competition that tasked teams with developing software for a humanoid robot designed to perform tasks on Mars. This challenge was part of NASA's Centennial Challenges program, which seeks innovative solutions from the public for space exploration.

## Team WPI's Achievement

As a member of Team WPI, working out of the WPI Humanoid Robotics Lab, we competed against teams from around the world and were selected as **finalists** in this prestigious competition.

## The Challenge

Participants were required to develop software that would enable a simulated R5 Valkyrie humanoid robot to:

- Navigate the Martian terrain autonomously
- Perform maintenance tasks on a simulated Mars habitat
- Handle unexpected challenges and recover from failures
- Complete mission objectives within time constraints

## Our Approach

Our team developed innovative solutions for:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Algorithms for traversing uneven Martian terrain
- **Manipulation**: Software for precise control of the robot's arms and hands
- **Task Planning**: Strategic approaches to completing mission objectives efficiently
- **Fault Recovery**: Methods to detect and recover from unexpected situations

## My Contributions

As a freshman at WPI working in the Humanoid Robotics Lab, I contributed to:

- Motion planning and control systems
- Integration of perception and navigation components
- Testing and validation of autonomous behaviors
- Documentation and team coordination

## Impact

This experience was formative for my career in space systems. The skills and knowledge gained from this competition directly contributed to my later work at SpaceX and my current role at Inversion Space.

## Recognition

Being recognized as finalists in a NASA competition validated our team's technical abilities and the strength of WPI's robotics program. This achievement opened doors to further opportunities in space robotics and systems engineering.
