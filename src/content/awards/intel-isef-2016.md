Placed **2nd place** in the category of Engineering Mechanics at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair alongside Project Maverick.

## About Intel ISEF

The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) is the world's largest international pre-college science competition. Each year, approximately 1,800 high school students from more than 80 countries, regions, and territories are awarded the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for prizes.

## My Achievement

At ISEF 2016, I presented Project Maverick - my omni-directional robotic mobility system designed to help people with walking disabilities. The project was evaluated by expert judges in the Engineering Mechanics category, where I earned 2nd place.

## Additional Awards at ISEF 2016

Throughout ISEF 2016, I also received:

- **Best in Show from the International Council of System Engineers (INCOSE)** - Recognizing excellence in systems engineering approach
- **Minor Planet 33662 named "Tacescu"** in my honor - An asteroid was named after me as recognition of my scientific achievements

## The Competition

Competing at ISEF was an incredible experience. Being surrounded by brilliant young scientists and engineers from around the world was both humbling and inspiring. The rigorous judging process challenged me to clearly articulate the engineering principles behind Project Maverick and defend my design decisions.

## Presentation Materials

The poster I presented at the 2016 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair showcased:

- The problem of mobility challenges for people with walking disabilities
- The innovative omni-directional drive system
- Engineering analysis and testing results
- Future development plans

## Impact

This recognition at ISEF validated years of work on Project Maverick and opened doors for further development and opportunities, including my appearance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.
