As a part of the WPI Robotics Club, we developed this 2018 FIRST FRC robot in just 3 days after the game reveal.

## What is Robot in 3 Days (RI3D)?

Robot in 3 Days is an annual tradition in the FIRST Robotics community where teams attempt to design, build, and test a functional competition robot within 72 hours of the game reveal. The goal is to:

- Demonstrate rapid prototyping techniques
- Provide inspiration and ideas for FRC teams
- Document the build process for educational purposes
- Showcase what's possible with focused effort and teamwork

## The Challenge: FIRST Power Up (2018)

The 2018 FIRST FRC game, Power Up, was an arcade-themed challenge where robots had to:

- Collect and place "power cubes" onto scales and switches
- Climb a scale at the end of the match
- Work cooperatively with alliance partners
- Navigate around the field efficiently

## Our Approach

Within the 72-hour window, our team at WPI:

### Day 1: Design

- Analyzed the game rules and identified key strategies
- Brainstormed mechanisms for cube manipulation
- Created CAD designs for major subsystems
- Began prototyping critical mechanisms

### Day 2: Fabrication

- Manufactured chassis and structural components
- Assembled the drivetrain
- Built the cube intake and delivery mechanism
- Integrated electrical systems

### Day 3: Integration & Testing

- Completed mechanical assembly
- Wired and programmed the robot
- Conducted initial testing and iteration
- Documented the final product

## Key Features

Our RI3D robot included:

- **Robust Drivetrain**: Tank drive capable of navigating the field quickly
- **Cube Intake**: Mechanism to reliably acquire power cubes
- **Delivery System**: Capable of placing cubes on the switch and scale
- **Simple & Reliable**: Focused on core gameplay over complexity

## Impact

This RI3D project helped:

- Inspire FRC teams watching our documentation
- Demonstrate effective rapid prototyping techniques
- Showcase the capabilities of the WPI Robotics Club
- Provide a learning experience for club members

## Team Effort

This project was a collaborative effort by members of the WPI Robotics Club, combining skills in mechanical design, electrical systems, and programming to achieve an impressive result in a very short timeframe.
