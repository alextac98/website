If I were to attribute my success as an engineer to one experience, it would be my time on FIRST FRC Team 2761.

## Overview

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition where teams of students design, build, and program robots to compete in an annual challenge. My four years on Team 2761 at Clovis North High School were transformative for my engineering career.

## My Role

As the **Engineering Team Leader** of FRC Team 2761, I was responsible for:

- Leading the mechanical and electrical design of our competition robots
- Coordinating between sub-teams (mechanical, electrical, programming, business)
- Making critical design decisions under tight competition deadlines
- Mentoring younger team members
- Representing the team at competitions and outreach events

## What I Learned

My time on FRC Team 2761 taught me invaluable skills:

### Technical Skills
- Mechanical design and fabrication
- CAD modeling and prototyping
- Electrical systems design
- Programming and control systems
- Project management under pressure

### Soft Skills
- Team leadership and collaboration
- Communication and presentation
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Time management with strict deadlines
- Mentorship and teaching

## Impact

The experience of designing, building, programming, and testing robots from scratch ignited my passion for robotics engineering. The skills I developed on this team directly contributed to my later successes, including:

- Project Maverick and appearances on The Tonight Show
- Success at Intel ISEF and other science fairs
- My academic career in Robotics Engineering at WPI
- My professional career in robotics and space systems

## FIRST Values

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) emphasizes "Gracious Professionalism" and "Coopertition" - values that I carry with me to this day in my professional work.

## Gratitude

I'm deeply grateful to my mentors, teammates, and coaches who made this experience possible. The lessons learned during those four years continue to shape my approach to engineering challenges.
