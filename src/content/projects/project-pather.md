Project Pather is a kiosk mapping software developed to provide directions to Brigham and Women's Hospital.

## Overview

Navigating large hospital complexes can be challenging and stressful for patients and visitors. Project Pather was developed to address this problem by providing an intuitive wayfinding solution for Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

## The Problem

Large hospitals present significant navigation challenges:

- Complex layouts spanning multiple buildings and floors
- Patients and visitors often arrive stressed or in unfamiliar circumstances
- Traditional signage can be confusing or insufficient
- Staff time is consumed providing directions
- Accessibility needs vary among visitors

## Our Solution

Project Pather is a kiosk-based mapping application that:

- Provides step-by-step directions to any destination in the hospital
- Offers an intuitive touch-screen interface
- Supports multiple languages for diverse patient populations
- Accounts for accessibility requirements (elevators, ramps, etc.)
- Displays estimated walking times
- Can print directions for visitors to take with them

## Technical Implementation

The system was built using:

- **Frontend**: Interactive touch-screen interface with intuitive UX
- **Backend**: Graph-based pathfinding algorithms
- **Database**: Hospital floor plans and point-of-interest data
- **Pathfinding**: A\* algorithm for optimal route calculation
- **Accessibility**: Support for wheelchair-accessible routes

## Key Features

### Interactive Maps

- Zoomable, pannable floor plans
- Clear visual representation of routes
- Landmark indicators for easier navigation

### Smart Routing

- Shortest path calculation
- Accessible route options
- Multi-floor navigation with elevator/stair guidance

### User-Friendly Interface

- Large, easy-to-read text
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Multiple language support

## Impact

Project Pather demonstrated how technology can improve the healthcare experience by:

- Reducing patient and visitor stress
- Decreasing time spent searching for destinations
- Freeing up staff from providing directions
- Improving overall hospital efficiency
- Enhancing accessibility for all visitors

## Collaboration

This project was developed as part of coursework at WPI, working with Brigham and Women's Hospital to understand their specific wayfinding challenges and develop a practical solution.
