This project is an Android application designed to help social workers in Paraguay better help those in need.

## Overview

Throughout my sophomore year at WPI, I completed my Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP). My team and I developed an application for Poverty Stoplight, an organization that helps social workers create better-customized plans to help those in need to get out of poverty.

## The Problem

Social workers in Paraguay and other developing nations face significant challenges in:

- Tracking the progress of families they work with
- Creating customized intervention plans
- Managing large caseloads efficiently
- Measuring the impact of their interventions

## Our Solution

We developed an Android application that enables social workers to:

- Conduct standardized assessments of family needs
- Visualize poverty indicators using a "stoplight" system (red, yellow, green)
- Track progress over time
- Generate reports and insights
- Create targeted action plans based on specific needs

## Technical Implementation

The application was built using:

- Android (Java) for the mobile application
- Firebase for backend data storage and synchronization
- Material Design principles for user interface
- Offline-first architecture for areas with limited connectivity

## Impact

The Poverty Stoplight methodology has been adopted by organizations in over 50 countries. Our application contributed to:

- Improved efficiency for social workers
- Better data collection and analysis
- More targeted interventions for families in need
- Measurable tracking of poverty reduction progress

## Team

This was a collaborative project completed as part of WPI's Interactive Qualifying Project requirement, working directly with the Poverty Stoplight organization in Paraguay.
