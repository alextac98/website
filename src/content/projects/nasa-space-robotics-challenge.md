## What is NASA's Space Robotics Challenge?

The NASA Space Robotics Challenge was an industry competition that tasked teams with developing software for a humanoid robot designed to perform tasks on Mars. As a part of the WPI Humanoid Robotics Lab, our team competed as finalists in this prestigious competition.

## Our Approach

Working in the WPI Humanoid Robotics Lab, we developed sophisticated software solutions for controlling a simulated humanoid robot in a Martian environment. The challenge required us to program the robot to:

- Navigate complex terrain autonomously
- Manipulate objects and tools
- Complete mission-critical tasks in a simulated Mars habitat
- Handle communication delays and autonomous decision-making

## Team Contributions

As a member of Team WPI, I contributed to:

- Robot motion planning and control algorithms
- Autonomous navigation systems
- Task planning and execution strategies
- Integration of perception and manipulation systems

## Results

Our team was selected as **finalists** in the NASA Space Robotics Challenge, demonstrating our ability to develop cutting-edge robotics software for space exploration applications.

## Impact

This experience provided invaluable insights into:

- Space robotics requirements and constraints
- Autonomous systems for remote operation
- Team collaboration on complex robotics projects
- Working with NASA standards and requirements

The skills and knowledge gained from this competition have been instrumental in my career in the space industry.
