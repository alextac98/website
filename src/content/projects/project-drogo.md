We developed a wearable device designed to assist elderly people through post-hip surgery recovery.

## Overview

Project Drogo was created during HealthHacksRI, a healthcare-focused hackathon. Our team identified a critical need in post-operative care for elderly patients recovering from hip surgery.

## The Problem

Hip surgery recovery is challenging for elderly patients because:

- Maintaining proper movement restrictions is difficult
- Physical therapy exercises must be performed correctly
- Patients often lack real-time feedback on their movements
- Recovery progress can be hard to track objectively

## Our Solution

We developed a wearable device that:

- Monitors patient movement in real-time
- Provides feedback to ensure proper form during exercises
- Alerts patients when they exceed safe movement ranges
- Tracks recovery progress over time
- Communicates data to healthcare providers

## Technical Implementation

Project Drogo utilized:

- IMU sensors for accurate motion tracking
- Microcontroller-based processing
- Bluetooth connectivity for data transmission
- Mobile application for user interface
- Cloud backend for data storage and analysis

## Recognition

Project Drogo won at HealthHacksRI, demonstrating the viability and impact of our approach to improving post-operative recovery outcomes for elderly patients.

## Impact

This project highlighted the potential for wearable technology to:

- Improve patient outcomes through better adherence to recovery protocols
- Reduce healthcare costs by enabling remote monitoring
- Empower patients with actionable feedback
- Provide healthcare providers with objective recovery metrics
